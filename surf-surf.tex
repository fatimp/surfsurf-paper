\title{Robust surface correlation functions evaluation from discrete digital
  images}

\begin{abstract}
  Pore-scale modelling based on the 3D structural information of porous
  materials has enournous potential in assessing physical properties beyond the
  capabilities of laboratiry methods. Such capabilities are pricely in terms of
  computational expenses - this limits the applicability of the direct
  simulations to a small volume and requires high performance computational
  resources, espeically for multi-phase flow simulations. The only pore-scale
  technique capable of dealing with large representative volumes of porous
  samples is pore-network (PNM) based modelling. The problem of PNM approach is
  that 3D pore geometry first needs to be simplified into a graph of pores and
  throats that conserve topological and geometrical properties of the original
  3D image. While a lot of progress was achieved in terms of geometry
  representation, no methodology provides full conservation of the topological
  features of the pore structure.  In this paper we present a pore-network
  extraction algorithm for binary 3D images based on discrete Morse theory and
  persistent homology that by design targets topology preservation. In addition
  to methdological developments, we also clarify the relationship between
  topological characteristics of constructed Morse chain complex and
  pore-network elements. We show, that the Euler numbers calculated for PNMs
  based on our methodology coincide with those obtained using the direct
  topological analysis. The characteristics of extracted pore-network are
  calculated for several 3D porous binary images and compared with the results
  of maximum inscribed balls-based, watershed-based and hybrid approach to
  support our methdology.

\section{Introduction}
Correlation functions (CFs) are invaluable universal descriptors of structure
and in this context are utilized in a multitude of scientific disciplines:
material sciences \cite{Cecen,chen2022quantifying}, rock
\cite{ledesma2018effect} and soil physics
\cite{Euras2012,PLoS_ONE,KarsaninaEJSS}, cosmology \cite{TakadaJain} and food
engineering \cite{Derossi2019}, to name just a handful. As such, CFs were used
to characterize the morphology \cite{tensorPRE} and representativeness via
correlation lengths \cite{vcapek2011transport,thovert2011grain}, compare
structures \cite{jiao2014chawla,EPL1,REVpaper}, compress structural information
\cite{SciRep1,Havelka,KarsaninaEJSS}, describe structural dynamics
\cite{chen2015dynamic,PLoS_ONE,xu2022correlation}, extract features for deep
learning \cite{Miao2017,kamrava2020linking,roding2020predicting,KarsaninaEJSS},
perform stochastic reconstructions
\cite{Adler_recon,Y-T,EPL2,tahmasebiPRL,karsaninaPRL} and fuse multi-scale
images \cite{SciRep1,chen2016stochastic,Geoderma2018}. Stochastic reconstruction
is a special topic of interest, as this approach allows to solve an inverse
problem and recover structure from a known set of correlation functions â€“- and
this ability for recovery is the basis for majority of potential usages in the
list above. Early reconstruction techniques mainly involved two-point
probability $S_2$ function, but were improved to include lineal $L_2$ function
\cite{Y-T,vcapek2009stochastic,vcapek2011transport}, cluster $C_2$ function
\cite{JiaoPNAS,jiao2014chawla} and potentially surface-surface $F_{ss}$
function. With the proper handling \cite{EPL2} it is possible to incorporate
numerous CFs into a reconstruction procedure. Increasing the number (and order)
of functions leads to higher information content of the CFs set
\cite{Gommes1,Gommes2}, thus, it allows to reconstruct and perform
stationarity/representativeness characterization \cite{REVpaper} for structures
of any complexity.

There are two ways to obtain correlation functions for a given structure at hand
-- either measure them experimentally with the help of scattering intensity
\cite{debye1957scattering,li2018accurate}, or measured from images. The first
approach suffers from the limitation of CFs that can be obtained this way
\cite{Gommes_notchord}, while the second one provides information with limited
resolution or/and resolution to field-of-view ratio \cite{SciRep1}. Moreover,
the most useful imaging methods such as X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) due to their underlying physical principles
provide gray-scale images which need to be segmented into constituent phases
before CFs computation. It is important to note that such gray-scale images do
not represent phases spatial distribution, but, for example, X-ray spatial
attenuation or electron back-scattering intensities. However, if properly
segmented, high-resolution digital images do provide a possibility to compute
any correlation function. Experimental measurements using small angle scattering
(SAS) are traditionally used to evaluate $S_2$, but it is also possible to
relate scattering intensities to surface correlation functions
\cite{dietrich1995scattering,ma2018SS}. It would be of great practical
importance to obtain surface correlation functions from both SAS and imaging
(focused ion beam milling combined with SEM allows to obtain the finest imaging
resolutions comparable to SAS and sample CFs from polished surfaces as opposed
to surface imaging \cite{FIB-SEMpaper}) to estimate coefficients for surface and
bulk scattering (see Eq.13 in \cite{ma2018SS}). But there is a catch -- SAS
possesses close to infinite surface resolution as opposed to digital pixelized
images with inherent segmentation problems due to partial volume effects,
something we discuss next.

Recently, Ma and Torquato \cite{ma2018SS} laid foundation to precise surface
correlation function computations and showed the usefulness of these CFs
evaluation for numerous problems. They have implemented an elegant solution with
the help of infinite resolution random fields that allows finding an exact
intersection with the sampling line. In addition, they also showed that surface
CFs for digital images can be computed by converting integer fields (i.e.,
location of the phases) to float fields with the help of Gaussian filter
\cite{ma2018SS}. Unfortunately, their solution is not readily applicable to the
majority of grey-scale images due to non-singularity in their chemical
constitution. The reason is the difference between the contour and real
interface between different phases within the material due to the partial volume
effects \cite{Wildenschild_Sheppard} for XCT imaging -- the presence of multiple
phases within the same pixel/voxel. In other words, the attenuation is a
function of both density and atomic number, which usually are distributed
non-uniformly below the XCT imaging resolution. Somewhat similar is also
relevant for SEM imaging, as secondary or back-scattered electrons are
effectively a convolution of partial signals coming from different depths
\cite{Bultreys_review}. The exact sub-voxel thresholding based on gray-scale
image (similar to the technique used in \cite{ma2018SS}) is only available in
case it is monomineral, i.~e., the solid phase consists of a completely
chemically homogeneous substance that contrasts perfectly with air/vacuum filled
pore phase -- this is rarely the case for natural materials. Moreover, even if
the image of a monomineral sample has sub-resolution features on XCT image,
while it is possible to compute the porosity of the voxel, it's still not
possible to extract the interface. All these and additional problems (such as,
for example, experimental noise and artifacts from inverse Radon transform)
arising during gray-scale image processing as related to image segmentation were
extensively discussed elsewhere \cite{NNseg}. In other words, simple
thresholding of the grey-scale image to compute surface functions using the
approach proposed in \cite{ma2018SS} (their section V.C) may result in incorrect
surface identification and surface functions are not defined for grey-scale
images (due to possible sub-resolution porosity). The usage of current
state-of-the-art segmentation techniques is necessary prior to the conversiton
to a coarse-grained scalar field. If a binary image (consisting of pores and
solids) is produced by adequate segmentation technique, we still lack a robust
and computationally effective procedure to evaluate surface CFs from
experimental XCT and SEM images of natural heterogeneous materials, such as
rocks and soils.

The surface area in \cref{eq:surface} has infinitesimal volume, and its
location on the digital image is not easy due to the pixelization of the
interface between the binary phases \cite{ma2018SS}. By adopting the
$\varepsilon$ = pixel/voxel size one can create a very crude approximation of
the real interface, but the usage of interfaces between voxels ``as is'' leads
to known problems in $s$ and surface geometry, in application of 3D imaging for
geometry and topology analysis \cite{AWR_PNM} or energy minimization problems
\cite{frank2018energy}. Another option would be to describe the boundaries
between voxels with some curves, e.~g., splines. This way it would be possible
to perform surface CFs sampling by line intersection as described by Ma and
Torquato \cite{ma2018SS}. While an exact boundary can be obtained for
deterministic structures such as disk/sphere packings, splines would provide
only a very approximate solution for the boundaries of arbitrary digitized
structure due to the limit in resolution for a given image
\cite{gerke2012tomographic}. In other words, contours extracted from digital
images will approach real boundaries between phases only when the spatial
resolution approaches infinity. But the same is also true for digital
pixelized/voxelized images. Thus, the options to compute surface correlation
functions include ``continuous'' approach (such as implemented in
\cite{ma2018SS}) and ``digital'' approach (similar to computation of $S_2$ from
digital images) as depicted in \cref{fig:scheme}. We adopt the modified
``digital'' approach that lies in between the exact and pixelized solutions for
a number of reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For a binarized XCT or SEM image the interpolation of the interface
    using "continuous" or "digital" in the limit of $\varepsilon \to 0$ would
    produce the same results. Thus, as it is not possible to obtain the exact
    continuous interface from such an image, using "digital" approach is natural
    as applied to digital pixel/voxel images.
  \item Continuous approach is expensive numerically, as it requires to find the
    intersections between a line and a curve.
  \item Digital approach allows to utilize linear scan or FFT - the latter is a
    fastest way to evaluate full CFs map.
\end{enumerate}

In this paper we build upon foundational work of Ma and Torquato \cite{ma2018SS}
and develop a robust and efficient approach to compute surface correlation
functions from digital 2D and 3D images. The rest of the manuscript is organized
as follows: in \cref{sec:details} we provide all methodological details for
surface CFs computation including analytical solutions to verify the proposed
methodology and describe an image library for extensive testing of our
algorithms, \cref{sec:results} presents all major results of surface functions
evaluations. We discuss obtained results, including the effects of image
scaling, and outline future uses of surface functions within
\cref{sec:outline}. The paper concludes with a summary in \cref{sec:summary}.

\section{Theoretical background}
\label{sec:theory}
\subsection{Correlation functions and definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}
Firstly, we introduce an indicator function $I^{(i)}(\mathbf{x})$ which marks
pixels of 2D and voxels of 3D digitized images as belonging to the phase $i$ or
not. It can be defined so:
\begin{equation*}
  I^{(i)}(\mathbf{x}) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    1 & \quad \mathbf{x} \in V_i \\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation*}
where $V_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is the region occupied by phase $i$. For
statistically homogeneous media the ensemble average of $I^{(i)}$ equals volume
fraction of a given phase. For binary media the following equality holds:
\begin{align*}
  \phi_{void} &+ \phi_{solid} = 1 \\
  \phi_i &= \langle I^{(i)}(\mathbf{x}) \rangle
\end{align*}
In a similar fashion we can define an interface indicator function
$M(\mathbf{x})$ which provides interface area $s$ if averaged over the whole
image:
\begin{align}
  M(\mathbf{x}) = |\nabla I^{(solid)}(\mathbf{x})| &= |\nabla I^{(void)}(\mathbf{x})|
  \label{eq:interface} \\
  \langle M(\mathbf{x}) \rangle &= s
  \label{eq:surface}
\end{align}
The simplest, yet foundational correlation function is the two-point probability
function $S_2$ which is defined as a probability that the ends of a random line
segment belong to the same phase:
\begin{equation}
  S_2^{(i)}(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2) = \langle I^{(i)}(\mathbf{x}_1)
  I^{(i)}(\mathbf{x}_2) \rangle \label{eq:twopoint}
\end{equation}
This equation can be further simplified for statistically homogeneous media, as
$S_2$ will dependent only on the relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$:
\begin{equation*}
  S_2^{(i)}(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2) = S_2^{(i)}(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation*}
The value of $S^{(i)}_2(\mathbf{r})$ at $\mathbf{r} = 0$ is a fraction of phase
$i$ in a medium:
\begin{equation}
  S_2^{(i)}(0) = \phi_i \label{eq:s2porosity}
\end{equation}
For isotropic media a vector displacement $\mathbf{r}$ can be replaced with its
length $r = |\mathbf{r}|$ and $S_2(\mathbf{r})$ with $S_2(r) = S_2(|\mathbf{r}|)$.
Now, analogously to $S_2$ we can define surface-surface and surface-void
correlation functions (for homogeneous and isotropic media straight away):
\begin{align}
  F_{ss}(r) &= \langle M(x)M(x+r) \rangle \label{eq:fss} \\
  F_{sv}(r) &= \langle M(x)I^{(void)}(x+r) \label{eq:fsv} \rangle
\end{align}

The interface indicator function $M(x)$ is basically defined as infinity on the
interface and zero elsewhere. Therefore, it is hard to directly compute
$\langle M(x), M(x + r) \rangle$. We can replace the line of zero width and infinite value
with a strip of width $\varepsilon$ and value $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$: $M(x; \varepsilon)$.
Then $F_{ss}(x; \varepsilon) = \langle M(x; \varepsilon), M(x + r; \varepsilon) \rangle$
is simply an intersection area of two strips -- original and shifted --
multiplied by $(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^2$.
And with $\varepsilon \to 0 \Rightarrow F_{ss}(r; \varepsilon) \to F_{ss}(r)$.
Area between two black dashed circles on \cref{fig:Fss-explained} represents
$M(x; \varepsilon)$, red is for $M(x + r; \varepsilon)$. Blue color marks the
intersection area. More detailed information on two-point probability and
surface correlation functions can be found in comprehensive Torquato's book
\cite{Torquato_book}.

    between pore and solid phases with pixelized ``digital'' interface emerging
    due to limited resolution of digital images.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analytical solutions}
For Poisson disks and balls one can derive exact analytical surface-surface and
surface-void functions. For overlapping disks with radius $R$ and centers
generated by Poisson point process with parameter $\lambda$ we have (see the
derivation of these formulas in \cref{ap:overlapping-disks}):
\begin{align}
  F_{sv}(r) &= S_2(r) \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    2(\pi - B)R \lambda & \quad r<2R \\
    2\pi R \lambda & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right. \label{eq:fsv_final} \\
  F_{ss}(r) &= S_2(r) \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{(2(B-\pi)R\lambda)^2Ar + 4\sqrt{A}R^2\lambda}{Ar} & \quad r<2R \\
    (2\pi R\lambda)^2 & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right. \label{eq:fss_final}
\end{align}

where $S_2$ is the regular two-point correlation function and
\begin{align*}
  A &= 4R^2 - r^2 \\
  B &= \arccos(\frac{r}{2R})
\end{align*}

For 3D balls the relationships are readily available in the literature
\cite{Torquato_book,ma2018SS}:
\begin{align*}
  F_{sv}(r) &= S_2(r) \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    4\pi R^2\lambda(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{4R}) & \quad r<2R \\
    4\pi R^2\lambda & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right. \\
  F_{ss}(r) &= S_2(r) \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    {(4\pi R^2 \lambda (\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{4R}))^2 + \frac{2\pi R^2 \lambda}{r}} & \quad r<2R \\
    (4\pi R^2 \lambda)^2 & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{align*}

These analytical solutions will be used to verify the accuracy of our evaluation
of surface CFs for such systems.

\section{Methodological details}
\label{sec:details}
By looking at \cref{eq:twopoint} and \cref{eq:fss}-\cref{eq:fsv} one can observe
some significant similarities between two-point probability and two-point
surface functions (see \cref{fig:scheme}). They will help us in
computations. $S_2$ can be viewed as a autocorrelation of the image, i.~e.,
computing correlations between shifted realization of the image -- something
that can be used to effectively compute $S_2$ with the help of fast Fourier
transform (FFT) on modern hardware, especially GPUs. If we apply the same
analogy to $F_{ss}$, \cref{eq:fss} can be considered as an intersection of the
interface with itself for all possible shifts. Recall that for the correlation
length of zero this intersection is technically infinity
(\cref{sec:definitions}). While surface-void function is well defined at $r=0$,
it differs from $S_2$ in two significant aspects. First, it resembles two-point
cross-correlation function (as instead of autocorrelation we have to compute
correlation between the interface and the void phase). Second, such
cross-correlation is not commutative, so we get two surface-void functions:
correlation between an interface and a void phase and correlation between a void
phase and an interface. These considerations will be very useful in
understanding of our computational framework as described in this section.

\subsection{The algorithm}
While we present and compare a bunch of sligtly different methods to evaluate
surface CFs, they are all based on a single general algorithm for each surface
function as desribed below.

$F_{ss}$ algorithm:
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Procedure{surfsurf}{$A, i$}
  \State $A' \gets I^{(i)}(A)$
  \Comment{Apply indicator function to $A$.}
  \State $M \gets S(A')$
  \Comment{Extract interface from $A'$.}
  \State \textbf{return} $S_2(M)$
  \Comment{Autocorrelation of $M$.}
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

$F_{sv}$ algorithm:
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Procedure{surfsurf}{$A, i$}
  \State $A' \gets I^{(i)}(A)$
  \Comment{Apply indicator function to $A$.}
  \State $M \gets S(A')$
  \Comment{Extract interface from $A'$.}
  \State $V \gets I^{(void)}(A')$
  \Comment{Extract void phase from $A'$.}
  \State \textbf{return} $M \star V$
  \Comment{Cross-correlation of $M$ and $V$.}
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

  \includegraphics[width=0.32\linewidth]{images/Fss_map_sobel.png}
  \caption{Steps of $F_{ss}$ algorithm using Sobel kernel}
  \label{fig:stages}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Interface extraction}
There are several methods for interface extraction.
We will focus on methods, that construct digital image of the same size.
Pixels (or voxels) take value between $0$ and $1$:
zero value -- inner part of phase, and positive value means pixel lies on the
interface.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/dm_sobel.png}
  \caption{Surface-surface correlation function calculated with different
    interface extraction methods (Sobel on the top, distance map on the
    bottom).}
  \label{fig:interface-extraction}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/direction_and_map.png}
  \caption{One direction $F_{ss}$ vs map average comparison}
  \label{fig:direction-vs-map}
\end{figure}


\textit{Distance map}.
This method creates binary image. 
The interface between binary phases is represented by a one
pixel thick contour (in two-dimensional case) or one voxel thick surface (in
three-dimensional case). This contour or surface is extracted from either solid
or void phase with the help of distance map transform with subsequent filtering
out of pixels/voxels with distances greater than $1$.

\textit{Image filtering}.
This method creates grayscale image. We use Sobel operator to detect edges of
the image $A'$, later denoted as $\nabla A$: $\nabla A' = S(A')$. We calculate
$\|\nabla A'\|$ element-wise ($\|\cdot\|$ denotes the usual norm on Euclidean
space). This norm can be interpreted as the probability that a point in $A$
belongs to the interface. In a digitized image $\|\nabla A'\|$ can be
represented as an array of floating point numbers having the same shape as an
original image $A$.

\textbf{Computing correlation}
We will describe method of computing cross correlation function between two
images $f$ and $g$: $cross\_correlation(f, g)$. In the case of auto correlation
function we assume $f = g$. Algorithm is straightforward when boundary
conditions are periodic. For non-periodic boundary conditions we will need a
minor change.

\textit{Periodic boundary condition}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Procedure{cross\_correlation}{$f, g$}
  \State $\hat{f} = F(f)$
  \State $\hat{g} = F(g)$
  \Comment Compute FFT of the input.
  \State $\hat{cc} \gets \hat{f} \cdot \overline{\hat{g}}$
  \Comment Multiply element-wise.
  \State $cc \gets F^{-1}(\hat{cc})$
  \Comment Compute IFFT of $\hat{cc}$.
  \State \textbf{return} $cc$ divided by the number of pixels in the input.
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

\textit{Non-periodic boundary condition}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Procedure{cross\_correlation}{$f, g$}
  \State Pad $f$ and $g$ with zeros in each dimension to the size $2n-1$ where
  $n$ is the size of the image in that dimension.
  \State $\hat{f} = F(f)$
  \State $\hat{g} = F(g)$
  \Comment Compute FFT of the input.
  \State $\hat{cc} \gets \hat{f} \cdot \overline{\hat{g}}$
  \Comment Multiply element-wise.
  \State $cc \gets F^{-1}(\hat{cc})$
  \Comment Compute IFFT of $\hat{cc}$.
  \State circle shift $cc$ by $n - 1$ in each direction, so index range becomes
  from $-(n - 1)$ to $n - 1$.
  \State $cc_{ij} \gets cc_{ij} / q_{ij}$ where $q_{ij} = (n - |i|)(m - |j|)$
  \Comment Divide each element $cc_{ij}$ by the number of pixels whose
  coordinate difference is equal to $(i, j)$.
  \State \textbf{return} $cc$.
  \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

All methods and their consecutive stages are shown in \cref{fig:stages}. They
are also a part of \code{CorrelationFunctions.jl} package \cite{CFsjlpaper} for
Julia programming language that allows to compute all classical CFs described in
Torquatoâ€™s book \cite{Torquato_book} from digital images.

\section{Application to synthetic and real binary 2D/3D images}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Comparisons against analytical solutions}
\label{sec:comparison}
To evaluate the accuracy of surface CFs computations the most straightforward
way is to compare them against analytical solutions. We use well-known
analytical soulution for overlapping disks and balls with fixed radius $R$ and
centers generated by Poisson point process. Starting with an image with
resolution of $4096 \times 4096$ pixels, we then downscale it by 4, 16, and 64
times with the help of bicubic interpolation \cite{ledesma2018effect}. We show
that calculated correlation functions approach theoretical values when the
resolution is high enough.

It is easy to show that assuming $a > 0$:
\begin{align}
  a^2 F_{ss}(a \mathbf{x}, a(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{r})) &= F_{ss}(\mathbf{x},
  \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{r}) \label{eq:scale-ss} \\
  a F_{sv}(a \mathbf{x}, a(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{r})) &= F_{sv}(\mathbf{x},
  \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{r}) \label{eq:scale-sv}
\end{align}
Assuming that our images represent homogeneous and isotropic media, we calculate
$F_{ss}(ar)$ and $F_{sv}(ar)$ for each original and rescaled image and multiply
it by coefficient $a^2 = (L_{scaled}/L_{orig})^2$ and $a = L_{scaled}/L_{orig}$
respectively, where $L_{scaled}$ is the side of the rescaled image and
$L_{orig}$ is the side of the original image. The resulting scaled surface CFs
are shown in \cref{fig:scaling}.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \centering
  \subfigure[Surface-surface]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.475\linewidth]{images/plot-ss-balls.png}
    \label{fig:fss-scaling}}
  \hfill
  \subfigure[Surface-void]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.475\linewidth]{images/plot-sv-balls.png}
    \label{fig:fsv-scaling}}
    \caption[]{The comparison of analytical and computed surface correlation
      functions for the Poisson disks for the original $4096 \times 4096$ pixels
      image. Computed CFs were obtained for different image resolutions as shown
      in the legend.}
    \label{fig:scaling}
\end{figure*}

We can observe two effects when downscaling the original image. The
first effect is that $F_{ss}(ar)$ and $F_{sv}(ar)$ for downscaled images lack in
detail (i.e. they are less ``noisy''). This can be easily explained by that the
interface between phases that becomes ``simpler'' when resolution decreases. The
second and much more important effect is that both correlation functions become
largely underestimated with the decline in resolution. This latter effect is in
general connected to the fact that the interface in digital images has
non-negligible thickness -- i.~e. the difference between real ``continuous''
interface versus ``digital'' interface (\cref{fig:scheme}). It is logical to
assume that with increasing spatial resolution the influence of this thickness
will diminish. This is exactly what we observe on \cref{fig:scaling} where
increasing disk discretization leads to convergence with analytical solution;
the accuracy of the computed CFs is almost perfect for discretization of about
4096 pixels for each disk. A natural question arises: ``Is there a criterion of
image quality (resolution) that allows to predict the quality of surface CFs
evaluation from digital images?''. Turns out there is a possibility to establish
such empirical criterion based on spectral analysis of input images and
\cref{sec:crit} provides necessary details.

Now consider a situation when an image is obtained by taking samples of a function
$f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \left\{0, 1\right\}$. The samples are taken from a
regular grid which covers the range $[0, 1]^n$  with interval $\Delta$ between
samples. The resulting image has then $1/\Delta + 1$ pixels in each
dimension. An example of $f$ is a thresholded value noise function, and an
example of image generated by sampling this function is on
\cref{fig:noise}. Correlation functions calculated for the noise at different
resolutions are on \cref{fig:scaling-noise}. If we calculate surface-surface and
surface-void correlation functions for these images and scale them as described
above, we will converge to some ``true'' correlation functions for continuous
function $f$.

\end{figure*}

You can use resizing to obtain images of higher dimensionality and calculate
surface functions for resized images to get more accurate result. Because a
resized image becomes grayscale we use the following function as an indicator
for the void phase provided the void phase is marked as 0 in the original image:
\begin{equation*}
  I^{(void)}(x) = (1 - x)^{1.5}
\end{equation*}
Assuming an original small image is already two-phase we use the following
indicator function used to reduce multiphase image to two phases: $I(x) = x$
which is simply an identity function.

All interpolation methods are good for resizing purposes with exception of
nearest-neighbor. At \cref{fig:resized} you can see images of overlapped disks
with almost same surface-surface and surface-void functions. Correlation
functions for the original small image, resized image and recalculated?? image
are shown on \cref{fig:resized-cfs}.

\subsection{The choice of method to extract the interface (gradient)}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/sobel-vs-distance-map.png}
  \caption{Comparison of Sobel filter and distance map on high-resolution image (60 pixels per disk radius)}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{images/kernels.png}
  \caption{Comparison of different filters.}
  \label{fig:kernels}
\end{figure}

As \cref{fig:interface-extraction} shows, both methods -- distance map and image filtering --
have an error compared to the analytical solution. But the image used for
\cref{fig:interface-extraction} is low resolution (about 10 pixels per
radius). What if we increase the resolution? \cref{fig:sobel-vs-distance-map}
shows a different picture: the image filtering method achieved an analytical
solution  while the distance map failed to do so. This is why we advocate the
use of image filtering to calculate surface features.

There are many different kernels for evaluating gradients. We investigated:
Sobel, Ando, Sharr, Bickley and Prewitt filters. Their performance is almost the
same (\cref{fig:kernels}). The errors against the analytical solution are
close. And different kernels work better for different images. Therefore, it is
difficult to recommend a specific kernel.

\subsection{Criterion for accurate evaluation of surface CFs from discrete images}
\label{sec:crit}
Let us define one-dimensional forward ($F$) and inverse ($F^{-1}$) Fourier
transforms as:
\begin{align}
  \hat{f}(z) &= F[f](z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)
  e^{-i\pi xz} dx \label{eq:fourier-forward} \\
  f(x) &= F^{-1}[\hat{f}](z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(z)
  e^{i\pi xz} dz \label{eq:fourier-backward}
\end{align}

Here $f(x)$ and $\hat{f}(z)$ can be thought of as representations of a signal in
the time domain and the frequency domain, respectively. Both equations
\cref{eq:fourier-forward} and \cref{eq:fourier-backward} preserve norm on $L_2$:
$(f, f) = (\hat{f}, \hat{f})$. It is said that Fourier transform preserves
``energy'' of the signal. According to Riemann-Lebesgue lemma \cite{HilbertSpaces}
energy of any signal ``concentrates'' around low frequencies. A measure of how
much energy concentrated in low frequencies (for some definition of low
frequencies) is a key to the understanding of the problem of correctness of our
method. The Shannon sampling theorem \cite{HilbertSpaces} states that it is
possible to reconstruct a band-limited signal $f(x)$ whose frequencies lie in
the range $[0, f]$ from a sequence of samples $\left\{f_n\right\}$ if the
sampling rate is no less than $2f$. We introduce a parameter $C_a$:
\begin{align*}
  f_0(x) &= f(x) - \langle f(x) \rangle \\
  C_a &= \frac{\int_{-a\omega}^{a\omega} |\hat{f_0}(z)|^2 dz}{\int_{-\omega}^{\omega} |\hat{f_0}(z)|^2 dz}
\end{align*}
where $\omega = 2\pi f$ and $\langle f(x) \rangle$ is the mean value of $f(x)$
over its domain. The criterion for correctness is then:
\begin{equation*}
  C_a > 1 - \xi
\end{equation*}
for some $a$ and $\xi$. This criterion tells us exactly how much energy in
$f_0(x)$ is concentrated in a low frequency range $[0, af]$ compared to the
whole range $[0, f]$. In our work we propose $a = 0.5$ and $\xi = 0.07$ as
a strict criterion which is based on results of \cref{sec:comparison}. For the
images of Poisson disks from \cref{fig:scaling} their discretizations and
$C_{0.5}$ are shown in \cref{fig:disks-res}. We immediately observe that the
image with resolution $4096 \times 4096$ has surface CFs very close to
analytical solution and satisfy our  $C_{0.5}$ criterion perfectly. The other
three downscaled images fail to satisfy the criterion. After looking at
\cref{fig:scaling} and \cref{fig:disks-res} we can claim that the criterion
correctly selects images which are suitable for calculation of the correlation
functions. The criterion $C_{0.5}$ decays fast with the decline in image
resolution as shown in \cref{fig:crit-plot}.

\subsection{Application to binary images of porous media}
\label{sec:application}
After the verification of our computational approach based on analytical
solution and establishing the criterion $C_{0.5}$ we now have enough tools to
evaluate surface CFs for different porous media images, including real XCT and
SEM images.

For demonstration purposes, we computed correlation functions for three
sandstone and three carbonate samples with dimensions
$500 \times 500 \times 500$ (\cref{fig:real-data}) all of which satisfy our
$C_{0.5}$ criterion. The result can be seen on \cref{fig:real-data-plots}.

There are examples of bad images which do not pass our criterion on
\cref{fig:real-bad}.

\appendix
\section{Derivation of analytical solutions for 2D Poisson disks}
\label{ap:overlapping-disks}
Analytic representation of surface-surface and surface-void correlation
functions for overlapping balls with centers generated by Poisson point process
is well known \cite{Torquato_book}:
\begin{align}
  F_{sv}(r) &= -\lim_{a_1 \rightarrow R} \frac{\partial}{\partial a_1}
  e^{-\lambda S_{tot}(r, a_1, R)} \label{eq:fsv-disks} \\
  F_{ss}(r) &= \lim_{a_1, a_2 \rightarrow R} \frac{\partial}{\partial a_1}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial a_2} e^{-\lambda S_{tot}(r, a_1,
    a_2)} \label{eq:fss-disks}
\end{align}
Here $S_{tot}(r, a_1, a_2)$ refers to a common volume of two n-dimensional balls
of radii $a_1$ and $a_2$ with a distance $r$ between their centers and $\lambda$
is a parameter of Poisson process. For two-dimensional disks we have the
following expression for $S_{tot}(r, a1, a2)$:
\begin{equation}
  S_{tot}(r, a_1, a_2) = \pi a_1^2 + \pi a_2^2 - S_{int}(r, a_1, a_2) \label{eq:total}
\end{equation}
where $S_{int}(r, a_1, a_2)$ is a common area of two disks, being equal to:
\begin{align}
  S_{int}(r, a_1, a_2) =&  a_1^2 \arccos(\frac{r^2+a_1^2-a_2^2}{2a_1r}) + \\
  & a_2^2 \arccos(\frac{r^2+a_2^2-a_1^2}{2a_2r}) - \\
  & \frac{\sqrt{Y}}{2} \label{eq:intersection}
\end{align}
when $r<2R$ and zero otherwise. $Y$ in \cref{eq:intersection} is
\begin{equation*}
  Y = (-r+a_1+a_2)(r+a_2-a_1)(r+a_1-a_2)(r+a_1+a_2)
\end{equation*}
Substituting \cref{eq:intersection} into \cref{eq:total} and then
\cref{eq:total} into \cref{eq:fss-disks} we obtain \cref{eq:fss_final} for
$F_{ss}(r)$.

Similarly substituting \cref{eq:intersection} into \cref{eq:total} and then
\cref{eq:total} into \cref{eq:fsv-disks} we obtain \cref{eq:fsv_final} for
$F_{sv}(r)$.

\section{Implementation of surface function computations}
The code used to compute surface correlation functions in this manuscript was
written in Julia language and available as a Jupyter notebook in Supplementary
Materials. It uses \code{CorrelationFunctions.jl} package developed by our group
\cite{CFsjlpaper} that allows efficient computation of surface and other
correlation functions using both CPU and GPU architectures.

\section{Surface-surface correlation function for one disk}
The analytical representation of the surface-surface correlation function for
one disk is as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  F_{ss}(r) = \lim_{a_1, a_2 \rightarrow R} \frac{\partial}{\partial a_1}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial a_2} S_{tot}(r, a_1, a_2)
\end{equation*}
Following the same steps as in \cref{ap:overlapping-disks} we get a simple
formula:
\begin{equation*}
  F_{ss}(r,R) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{4R^2}{r\sqrt{4R^2-r^2}} & \quad r < 2R \\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{equation*}
The resulting expression depends only on $t = r / 2R$:
\begin{equation*}
  F_{ss}(t) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{1}{t\sqrt{1-t^2}} & \quad t < 1 \\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{equation*}
You can see that as $t$ tends to $0$ on the right or $1$ on the left,
$F_{ss}(t)$ tends to infinity.
